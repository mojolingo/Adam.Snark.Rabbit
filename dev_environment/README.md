# Development Environment

1. Install `vagrant` and `berkshelf` gems
2. `vagrant up` to download, launch, and provision the VMs

This is a simple Vagrant based development environment. All the usual vagrant rules apply.

Start the VM using `vagrant up`. You will need to provide an admin password to enable NFS share setup.
